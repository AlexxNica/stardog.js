For more information, go to the Stardog's [Network Programming](http://stardog.com/docs/network/) documentation.\r\n\r\nThe framework is currently targeted to Node.js (the latest version) and it has not been fully tested in the browser, but future versions will be have browser compatibility.\r\nYou'll also need [npm](https://npmjs.org) to run the test cases and install the dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Development ##\r\n\r\nTo get started, just clone the project. You'll need a local copy of Stardog to be able to run the tests. For more information on starting the Stardog DB service and how it works, go to [Stardog's documentation](http://stardog.com/docs/), where you'll find everything you need to get up and running with Stardog.\r\n\r\nGo to [http://stardog.com](http://stardog.com), download and install the database and load the data provided in `data/` using the script in the repository. Having the Stardog service running load the data with the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ ./load_test_data.sh\r\n\r\nOnce you have the testing database in your Stardog copy, run the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install\r\n\r\nThis will install all the dependencies using npm, once this is done, run the test cases:\r\n\r\n    $ npm test\r\n\r\nThat will run all the test cases in `spec/`\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass.\r\n\r\n## NOTE ##\r\n\r\nThis framework is in continuous development, please check the [issues](https://github.com/clarkparsia/stardog.js/issues) page. You're welcome to contribute.\r\n\r\n"}
