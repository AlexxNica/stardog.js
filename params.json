For more information, go to the Stardog's [Network Programming](http://stardog.com/docs/network/) documentation.\r\n\r\nThe framework is currently targeted to Node.js (the latest version) and it has not been fully tested in the browser, but future versions will be have browser compatibility.\r\nYou'll also need [npm](https://npmjs.org) to run the test cases and install the dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install stardog.js locally from the npm registry simply execute:\r\n\r\n    npm install stardog\r\n    \r\nThat will fetch the latest version of stardog.js in the npm registry, [more details](https://npmjs.org/package/stardog).\r\n\r\n## Development ##\r\n\r\nTo get started, just clone the project. You'll need a local copy of Stardog to be able to run the tests. For more information on starting the Stardog DB service and how it works, go to [Stardog's documentation](http://stardog.com/docs/), where you'll find everything you need to get up and running with Stardog.\r\n\r\nGo to [http://stardog.com](http://stardog.com), download and install the database and load the data provided in `data/` using the script in the repository. Start Stardog with the `http` port on `5823` with the following command:\r\n\r\n\t$ stardog-admin server start --http 5823\r\n\r\nOnce you have Stardog running, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install\r\n    $ bower install\r\n\r\nThis will install all the dependencies using npm (for node) and bower (for browser), once this is done, run the test cases.\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass.\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\n\r\nRun all the test cases in `test/spec`. Having the Stardog server running, execute the following commands:\r\n\r\n1\\. Load the test data using the provided script:\r\n\r\n    $ ./load_test_data.sh\r\n\r\n2\\. Start the proxy via:\r\n\r\n    $ node test/testCORS.js\r\n\r\n3.\\ Run the test suite:\r\n\r\n#### In the Browser\r\n\r\n    open test/index.html\r\n\r\n#### In node.js\r\n\r\n    $ npm test    \r\n\r\n\r\n## Version details ##\r\n\r\nStardog.js depends of the Stardog HTTP API, and any change in this API will be supported by Stardog.js. Here's a list of version compatibility between __Stardog__ and  __Stardog.js__:\r\n\r\n| Stardog Version | Stardog.js Version |\r\n| --------------- | ------------------ |\r\n| <= 1.1.5        | <= 0.0.3           |\r\n| 1.2             | >= 0.0.4           |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick Example ##\r\n\r\n### Node.js\r\n\r\n    var stardog = require(\"stardog\");\r\n     \r\n    var conn = new stardog.Connection();\r\n     \r\n    conn.setEndpoint(\"http://myserver:myport/\");\r\n    conn.setCredentials(\"username\", \"password\");\r\n     \r\n    conn.query({ \r\n            database: \"myDB\", \r\n            query: \"select distinct ?s where { ?s ?p ?o }\",  \r\n            limit: 10, \r\n            offset: 0 \r\n        },\r\n        function (data) {\r\n            console.log(data.results.bindings);\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n### Browser\r\n\r\n__NOTE__: the Endpoint is a proxy to the Stardog HTTP interface in order to avoid CORS issues (an example can be fount in `test/testCORS.js`.\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"js/stardog.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n    …\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n        var conn = new Stardog.Connection();\r\n        conn.setEndpoint(\"/stardog\");\r\n        conn.setReasoning(\"QL\");\r\n        conn.setCredentials(\"browser\", \"secret\");\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\n## NOTE ##\r\n\r\nThis framework is in continuous development, please check the [issues](https://github.com/clarkparsia/stardog.js/issues) page. You're welcome to contribute.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
